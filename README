TwitSecret

University of Waterloo CS 858 Final project, Fall 2010
Kartikaya Gupta and Pengfei Zhang

This project provides a Firefox plugin that allows users to encrypt their
tweets such that they are only readable by the specified recipients. The plugin
inserts a "TweetSecretly" button next to the regular "Tweet" button on the
Twitter home page to allow the user to select the intended recipients. It
also replaces the tweet stream with one where tweets are decrypted, and
undecryptable tweets are filtered out.

In terms of architecture, there is a C component (src/*.c) which uses
libgcrypt to provide the required crypto primitives. The binary that is
produced from that code is installed into ffext/backend and shipped as
part of the plugin. It is invoked via Firefox's nsIProcess API and reads and
writes to files in ~/.twitsecret/ since I didn't have the time to figure out
Firefox's API for streams to nsIProcess.

The script in libs/ downloads and builds the gnupg-ecc library, which is
supposed to contain a version of libgcrypt with ECC encryption/decryption
support. I could never get that working, so you can mostly ignore it. The
script may still be useful if you don't have libgcrypt to build the binary
and don't want to install it on your system globally.

The Firefox XUL UI integration is minimal. The bulk of the hard work is done
in ffext/chrome/content/twitsecret.js, which has almost all of the script code
used to make the plugin work.

Note that as it stands there are a number of things that need to be done
before the plugin is usable by anybody other than me. The two main things
are compiling the binary for your platform and installing it into the
appropriate subfolder in ffext/backend. The second is obtaining API keys
from Twitter so that the plugin can actually use the API. You will need
to register a Twitter application at dev.twitter.com and put the consumer
key and the secret key into ffext/chrome/content/secrets.js like this:

___twitsecret.keys = {
    consumerKey: 'MY_CONSUMER_KEY',
    secretKey: 'MY_SECRET_KEY'
}

After that you can bundle the ffext folder into a xpi file, or just point
a text file called "projects.staktrace.ffext@staktrace.com" to the ffext
folder and install that to your Firefox extensions folder to get it working.

Good luck!
